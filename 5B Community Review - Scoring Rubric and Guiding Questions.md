# **Community Review - Scoring Rubric and Guiding Questions**

### **Elements to consider in reviews**
Community Reviewers must consider each of the following points as they undertake their reviews:
* Assign for each criteria a score between 1 and 5 based on the scoring rubric below 
* For each of the three criteria a score and rationale for your score must be provided.
* Each of the 3 sections should be considered and reviewed on its own merits; these sections are:
  * Impact ~ Does the proposal have the potential to provide a positive impact to Cardano?
  * Feasibility / Capability ~ Is the proposal feasible, and does the proposer have the capability to deliver the project successfully and manage Treasury funds properly?
  * Resources / Value for money ~ Does the proposal represent good value for money for the treasury and community? 
* Your rationale must explain the score you have given. If a rationale does not correspond with the score given, the review may be removed.
* Any score without a rationale will be filtered out, and you will not be compensated.
* Your rationale should help the voters decide, so make sure your considerations, scores and rationales are comprehensible.
* Consider and communicate what additional information or improvements the proposer could include in future funds.
* Be sure that you submit your review correctly.

 Each of the three scored sections of a proposal (Impact, Feasibility, Value for Money) will be marked 1-5, where [1 Star ★] = very poor answer, through to [5 Stars ★★★★★] = great answer.
>★ - VERY POOR ANSWER<br>★★ - POOR  ANSWER<br>★★★ - ACCEPTABLE ANSWER<br>★★★★ - GOOD ANSWER<br>★★★★★ - GREAT ANSWER

### **Examples of scoring and rationales**
The following are generic examples of scoring rationale for each of the three criteria. Please notethat these examples should not be directly copied; you should use your rationale when completing your review.
