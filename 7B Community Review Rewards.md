# **Community Review Rewards**

### **LV0 Rewards**
LV0 reviewers will receive a maximum of 17 ada per review. This amount could be less if many more reviews are completed by LV0 reviewers when the overflow of additional LV1 reviews that exceed the LV1 reviewerâ€™s auto-allocation is added to the LV0 pool of reviews.      

### **LV1 Rewards**
LV1s can expect a fixed amount of 33 ada per allocated review. If the LV1 reviewer wants to perform more reviews beyond the assigned allocation, then every additional review will be compensated as part of the LV0 pot of rewards.    

### **LV2 Rewards**
LV2s can expect to receive a maximum of 5 ada per flag check.  The effort here is anticipated to be straightforward and quick to accomplish for each flagged review.
