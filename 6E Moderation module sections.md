**Proposals**

In the Proposals section, LV2 Community Reviewers may find the list of all proposals funded in the current Fund along with the link to the Ideascale proposal and budget requested by the proposer. These are ordered by the proposal ID (descending).

**Community Reviews section**

Here Moderators will find a list of all reviews submitted in the current Fund for a reference to their current allocation.

Apart from that, there are three filters. Moderators can filter proposals by 
* reviewer
* proposal title
* challenge title

**Allocated Reviews section**

In this section, Moderators will find the list of assigned reviews to be moderated. Once a selection is chosen, basic information is displayed: proposal title, reviewer anonymized ID, and scoring for each criterion (impact, feasibility, and value for money).

There are also two checkboxes: *Flagged?* for reviews with flags, and *Already moderated*, which will be ticked once a particular review is moderated.
