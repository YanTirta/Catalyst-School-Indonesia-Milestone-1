# **Catalyst flags**
Once the Community Review stage is finished, Catalyst Team will exclude reviews that contain less than 150 characters in any of the categories (impact, feasibility, value for money) and then run scripts to flag reviews that are copy (or very similar) of another review, contains abusive language and written using AI.

Flagged reviews will be highlighted by having the checkbox *Flagged?* ticked.

Once the review is flagged as similar to another one, then a similar review will appear. Moderators may choose to Expand and compare reviews that seem very similar and then decide whether to accept the review.
