# **Moderation module guide**

A moderation module is a tool created for LV2 Community Reviewers (Moderators) to check any reviews flagged by the Catalyst scripts. Moderators decide whether flagged reviews should be included as a part of proposal reviews or not. Besides that, each Moderator will have assigned a small percentage of not-flagged reviews submitted by LV0 and LV1 Community Reviewers as a spot check.
