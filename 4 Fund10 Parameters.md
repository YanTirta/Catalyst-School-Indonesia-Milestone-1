|A19|fund_id|10|Fund_id as described in vote plan
|A20|Tallying optimization|1 ADA = 1 voting token (i.e. the stake amount in lovelace is divided by 1000000)|How voting power is being proportionally reduced in order to optimize tallying performance
||Rewards Parameters
|B1|Proposal Funding logic (winner selection rule)|Fuzzy threshold voting, proposals are ranked by the difference of Yes and No votes and funded one by one until challenge budget is exhausted|Proposals are ranked by sum of votes and funded in order. If the amount requested by a  proposal is larger than the remaining challenge amount, it is skipped
|B2|Proposal acceptance threshold|1% of total voting power<p>&nbsp;</p>15% more â€˜Yesâ€™ than â€˜Noâ€™|At least 1% of the total registered stake must vote on a proposal.<p>&nbsp;</p>E.g., there is 1 billion ADA as a total registered stake. To be accepted (become an â€˜approved proposalâ€™ as well as be eligible for funding), a proposal must be voted by at least 0.01 * (1 * 10^9) = 10 millions of ADA.<p>&nbsp;</p>'Yes'-'No' difference of the stake voted on proposal must be at least 15%.<p>&nbsp;</p>Formula: (YES-NO)/(YES+NO) > 0.15<p>&nbsp;</p>(e.g., 90% 'Yes' and 10% 'No', or 57.6% 'Yes' and 42.4% 'No', or 100% 'Yes' and 0% 'No', etc.; it is assumed that abstained stake does not vote on the proposal in the current architecture
|B3|Voting options and Funding logic in Catalyst Operations category|Yes/Abstain<p>&nbsp;</p>â€˜Noâ€™ option<p>&nbsp;</p>No thresholds|The winner is determined by the highest â€˜Yesâ€™ vote only
