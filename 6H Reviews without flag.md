# **Reviews without flag**
LV2 Community Review will have assigned a small percentage of not-flagged reviews. It is a spot check where Moderator decides whether the review should be included.

Once the moderator's work is concluded, the Catalyst team exports results and calculates which reviews should be included and which should be excluded based on the moderator's consensus.
