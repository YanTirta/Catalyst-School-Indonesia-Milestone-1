||Rewards Parameters
|B1|Proposal Funding logic (winner selection rule)|Fuzzy threshold voting, proposals are ranked by the difference of Yes and No votes and funded one by one until challenge budget is exhausted|Proposals are ranked by sum of votes and funded in order. If the amount requested by a  proposal is larger than the remaining challenge amount, it is skipped
|B2|Proposal acceptance threshold|1% of total voting power<p>&nbsp;</p>15% more â€˜Yesâ€™ than â€˜Noâ€™|At least 1% of the total registered stake must vote on a proposal<p>&nbsp;</p>E.g., there is 1 billion ADA as a total registered stake. To be accepted (become an â€˜approved proposalâ€™ as well as be eligible for funding), a proposal must be voted by at least 0.01 * (1 * 10^9) = 10 millions of ADA<p>&nbsp;</p>'Yes'-'No' difference of the stake voted on proposal must be at least 15%.<p>&nbsp;</p>Formula: (YES-NO)/(YES+NO) > 0.15<p>&nbsp;</p>(e.g., 90% 'Yes' and 10% 'No', or 57.6% 'Yes' and 42.4% 'No', or 100% 'Yes' and 0% 'No', etc.; it is assumed that abstained stake does not vote on the proposal in the current architecture

|B4|Vrtotal|2.50%<br>â‚³1,250,000|Voter Rewards<p>&nbsp;</p>Rewards are received by casting votes

Deliverable 1: Introducing the challenge during F10 launch<p>&nbsp;</p>2. Deliverable 2: Onboarding FPs and conducting PoL verification
|B8|Pam|1.20%<br>â‚³600,000<p>&nbsp;</p>Breakdown:<br>0.40% â‚³200,000 for<br>Project < â‚³150,000<br>- â‚³200 per Milestone PoA<p>&nbsp;</p>0.80% â‚³400,000 for<br>Project > â‚³150,000<br>- â‚³300 per Milestone PoA|Project Accountability Management Rewards<p>&nbsp;</p>Rewarding Community Reviewer help to verify:<br>1. Statement of Milestones (SoM)<br>2. Milestone Proof of Achievement<p>&nbsp;</p>[1] Funded projects will submit to Catalyst a Statement of Milestones<p>&nbsp;</p>SoM is verified by at least 2 community reviewers and rewarded ada for their work.<p>&nbsp;</p>[2] PoA conducted by a reviewer representative. PoA incentive is paid to reviewers.<p>&nbsp;</p>Where proposals are over â‚³200,000 reviews must be conducted by 2 separate reviewers.<p>&nbsp;</p>Maximum reward is â‚³200/â‚³300 each for 2 reviewers to carry out PoA.   
|B9|Voter Rewards Formula|Vrj=stakejstaketotalVrtotal|Voter rewards will be given for active participants only in proportion to the voting power voters have.<p>&nbsp;</p>stakej - voterâ€™s stake;<br>staketotal - total amount of â€˜activeâ€™ stake.
|B10|Community Review  LV0 reward formula|0.5%<br>â‚³250,000<p>&nbsp;</p>% Share of rewards taken from 20% of the allocated budget<p>&nbsp;</p>Maximum â‚³17 per review  
|B11|Community Review LV1 reward formula / $ price per LV1 Community reviewer reward |2%<br>â‚³1,000,000<p>&nbsp;</p>â‚³33 per review taken from 80% of the allocated  budget|A simple price paid per review 2% of total budget
|B12|Community Review LV2 (Community Moderators) reward formula / $ per Lv2 reward|0.4%<br>â‚³200,000<p>&nbsp;</p>Maximum â‚³5 per LV2 flagged review check
|B13|# of LV1 reviews that will be rewarded in a round|10-80 Reviews per LV1 Community Reviewer are rewarded under this parameter|A limit to how much an individual LV1 can be rewarded for their allocation in a single funding round.<p>&nbsp;</p>Minimum rewards threshold is â‚³330 in ada for 10 reviews. Any number of reviews under this amount will not be rewarded.<p>&nbsp;</p>Any reviews above the threshold allocation number (80) will be included into the LV0 pot
