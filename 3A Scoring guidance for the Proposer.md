1. IMPACT

### **Elements to consider when submitting your idea**
When submitting your idea, it is important that you consider the following as you formulate your proposal: 
Does your proposal clearly show a positive IMPACT for the Cardano ecosystem and its community? IMPACT means that the work you do on this project has a real, tangible positive effect or influence on the ecosystem. Does the project idea seem as if it has the potential to make a difference? Is the proposed impact realistic and achievable? Does the project team give high levels of confidence and assurances they will keep the community properly updated through correct and regular reporting?
Is your project proposal FEASIBLE within the plan and budget submitted? Please note, that should you be successful you will be required to submit a Statement of Milestones, more information is available in the ‘Associated Resources’ section. Does your team have the skills, experience, CAPABILITY and capacity to complete the project successfully? Will your project achieve an outstanding result? Is the plan easily understood? Are the outcomes easily verified? Are your timelines and KPIs reasonable and can they be achieved in the timeframe you propose?
Does the project represent VALUE FOR MONEY for the Community? Are the funds requested properly explained and is the amount of funding requested justified and reasonable? Has the proposal justified why Treasury funds are needed? Do you have the team RESOURCES available or are there gaps in your team that you need to hire for? Please remember that all costs must be calculated in ADA.
